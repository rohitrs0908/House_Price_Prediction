# Project Name : House Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
-Background: The project is being submitted as partial fulfilment of Advanced Certificate in Machine Learning and Deeping Learning course conducted jointly by IIIT, Bangalore and Upgrad.
- Business Problem: The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- Dataset Used: train.csv : The dataset contains the details of various attributes of the houses.


## Conclusions
- The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below: 
Ridge - 4
Lasso - 0.0001

- Top Five Predictors of Ridge are
OverallCond_9
Neighborhood_Crawfor
OverallQual_9
OverallCond_8
Neighborhood_StoneBr

- Top Five Predictors of Lasso are
OverallQual_10
OverallQual_9
OverallCond_9
FullBath_3
BsmtFullBath_2
